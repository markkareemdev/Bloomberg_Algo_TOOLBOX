"""Approach 1 (Linear Space Solution)

Use a hashtable to facilitate the cloning.

Complexities

Time: O( n )

We will perform linear time traversals that keep our asymptotic behavior linear.

Space: O( n )

We will store a clone mapping for each node entailing linear space complexity with respect to the original list passed to us.


Approach 2 (Constant Space Solution)

Use the original list's node's next pointer to map to the clone list.

Complexities

Time: O( n )

We are still only doing linear time traversals

Space: O( 1 )

We do not store any auxiliary space that will scale as the input size gets arbitrarily large.
